Each representation of a BAGG consists of the following sections, 
separated by whitespaces. Lines with starting '#' are treated as comments and are allowed between sections.

1. The number of Players, n.
2. The number of action nodes, |S|.
3. The number of function nodes, |P|.
   
4. The number of types for each player, as a row of n integers.
5. Type distribution for each player. The distributions are assumed to be independent. 
   Each distribution is represented as a row of real numbers.
   The following example block gives the type distributions for a BAGG with two players and two types for each player.
   0.5 0.5
   0.2 0.8

6. Size of type-action set for each player's each type.  

7. Type-action set for each player's each type.
   Each type-action set is represented as a row of integers in ascending order,
   which are indices of action nodes. Action nodes are indexed from 0 to |S|-1.

8. The action graph: same as in the AGG format. See the AGGFORMAT file for details.

9. types of functions: same as in the AGG format.

10. utility function for each action node: same as in the AGG format.
